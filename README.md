# Hack Oregon Housing Map
A proof of concept for the Hack Oregon's housing team of an interactive map loosely based off wireframes discussed during the week of 1/4/16.

Proof of concept goals:
- A reproduction of the portland neighborhood map from the [2016 State of Housing](https://www.portlandoregon.gov/phb/67393) report.
- Align the data from the report with the rendered geography.
- Create an input where the user can filter both the data on the map and in a text body.
